 ==============================

 KobraPy is an open education resource teaching open-source development
 practices and tools for newcomers. 

 It consists in a very simple version of the classical 80s' arcade snake game
 written in Python, that is provided as an initial codebase  that should be 
 further extended by the learner. It was originally created for the
 undergraduate course on Open Source Systems taught to Computer Sciences and
 Engineering students at the University of Sao Paulo.

 The challenge consists in

 a) fixing the listed known issues; 
   
 b) improving the game by adding some awesome new features.

 KobraPy is free software and can be distributed under the GNU General Public
 License vr.3 or any later version.
